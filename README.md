Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Trexcoin
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
appropriate channels.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/TrexcoinTREX/Trexcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Trexcoin.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.
